## 🔍 How It Works

### Upload Flow:
```
PDF Upload → Save to /uploads/ → Extract Text → Store in GridFS
                                      ↓              ↓
                              Chunk Text       Save file_id
                                      ↓              ↓
                              MongoDB chunks    MongoDB document
                                      ↓
                              FAISS vectors
```

### View Flow:
```
Click 👁️ → GET /documents/{id}/view → Fetch file_id from MongoDB
                                              ↓
                                    Retrieve from GridFS
                                              ↓
                                    Stream to browser
                                              ↓
                                    PDF opens in new tab
```

### Delete Flow:
```
Delete Document → Check file_id → Delete from GridFS
                                        ↓
                                Delete from FAISS
                                        ↓
                                Delete from MongoDB
```

## 📊 MongoDB Structure

### Documents Collection:
```json
{
  "_id": "doc123",
  "title": "Pricing Guide",
  "filename": "Pricing Guide.pdf",
  "file_id": "file_abc...",  ← Reference to GridFS
  "page_count": 10
}
```

### GridFS Collections:
```
fs.files → File metadata
fs.chunks → File data (binary chunks)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart Admin Service**:
   ```bash
   cd services/admin-service
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Test Upload**: Upload a PDF and click View

3. **Verify Storage**: Check MongoDB for `fs.files` and `fs.chunks` collections

4. **Production Ready**: System now stores and serves original files!
