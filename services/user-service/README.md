python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Database Configuration

# Or create tables directly
python -c "from database import engine; from models import Base; Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)"
```

### 4. Run the Service
```bash
# Development mode
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Production mode
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

## Integration with Other Services

This user service is designed to work with:
- **Auth Service**: Firebase authentication integration
- **Messaging Service**: Real-time communication
- **Booking Service**: Session scheduling and management
- **Payment Service**: Transaction processing

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- `models.py`: SQLAlchemy database models
- `schemas.py`: Pydantic request/response models
- `crud.py`: Database operations
- `dependencies.py`: FastAPI dependencies and utilities
- `database.py`: Database connection and session management
- `main.py`: FastAPI application and endpoints

### Adding New Features
1. Define models in `models.py`
2. Create schemas in `schemas.py`
3. Implement CRUD operations in `crud.py`
4. Add endpoints in `main.py`
5. Update documentation

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=.
```

## Deployment

### Docker
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t user-service .

# Run container
docker run -p 8001:8001 user-service
```

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key
- `ALGORITHM`: JWT algorithm (default: HS256)
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: Token expiration time

## Monitoring & Health Checks

The service includes:
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Structured logging
- Error handling and validation
- Database connection monitoring

## Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation with Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention with SQLAlchemy
- CORS configuration (configurable)

## Performance Considerations

- Database connection pooling
